## Decide what type of Layout and Design Fits your Needs?

The layout and design determine how the information will be structured when you create a website. There are five key design and usability points to consider when it comes to choosing the right website template:

* content width design ((1)Full-Width or (2)Box-Width)
* header layout
* Menu Bar Design

### content width design ((1)Full-Width or (2)Box-Width)

**Full-width** content area works well for creative, contemporary designs. **Boxed-width** content area is more suitable for traditional, business-oriented designs.

### header layout

Which Home Page Header Layout Works For Me?

Choosing the right header design for your home page is more of a strategic decision than a design decision. It depends on what type of business you have.

A carefully designed homepage header will successfully communicate your core message to your visitors.

> Your header section needs to create awareness and understanding of what you’re all about, rather than to simply look nice.

1. STATIC HEADER IMAGE with NO CONTENT

Who should use this?

Static image header should ONLY be used in websites that rely heavily on beautiful photographs to attract customers — portfolio, hotel, restaurant, some physical products or graphic intensive websites.

* navigation design
* logo placement
* overall usability and user experience

Who should not use this?

If your business requires text to explain what you do and how you can help your customers, relying solely on a static header image is not ideal.

> Ask yourself this question – Is your website easily explained through a simple image without any text?  

2. STATIC HEADER IMAGE with CONTENT

Who should use this?

All websites can benefit from this type of homepage header design — This the safest choice if you don’t know what to choose.

A static image header with content gives you 4 essential elements that can effectively describe what your business is about, directly Above-The-Fold:

Headline
Supporting paragraph
Call to action (what you want your visitors to do next)
Supporting image
The header image should play a supporting role rather than be the main focus. It should display your headline, subparagraph and primary call to action along with an image that reinforces your business mission.

3. SLIDESHOW HEADER with CONTENT

Who should use this?

A slideshow header works best for businesses that cater to a variety of customer types or have multiple core services or products.

If your company has different solutions for numerous customer demographics, a slideshow header allows the products / service offerings of your business to be showcased in an organized way.

4. VIDEO BACKGROUND HEADER

Who should use this:

A video background header works well to explain your business mission by featuring the scope your business process in an engaging way.

> Moving images or videos are very effective in grabbing people’s attention

Here are some tips to keep in mind if you decide to use a video background header design for your website:

1. **Use contextual video that carries a message** – don’t pick random videos. Pick videos that support your mission, message, or mood. This especially effective if you are a lifestyle brand.
2. **Use a unique video rather than a stock video** to give your website more personality and to create a connection with your audience.
3. **Use high-quality video that has high production value** – don’t use videos that have low visual quality as it reflects poorly on your business.
4. **Keep the video short and video file below 6MB.** A large video file can drastically slow down your website’s loading speed.

### Menu Bar Design

**Which Menu Bar Design Should I Choose?**

The menu bar might not look important, but it actually impacts how your visitors perceive you and your brand.

Many people tend to send their focus in the wrong direction when choosing a website template. The design is important, but the utility of the design trumps the aesthetics every single time.

> One of the most undervalued elements of a website design is the menu bar design. This includes the menu bar types, position, and layout.

Why is menu bar design such an important part of your theme?

The menu is the primary tool that your audience will use to navigate your website. It creates a road map to guide your visitors around your website and where they should focus their attention.

**THE DO’S & DON’TS OF MENU BAR DESIGN**

**Do's**:

+ Choose a clean, simple design that makes your menu tabs easy to read and access.

+ Use a color that’s easier on the eye as your menu background (nothing too sharp or flashy ). Highlight the menu tab text with a contrasting color to make them stand out.

+ Create a hierarchy for your pages. Layout your pages in decreasing importance from left to right (the most important pages goes to the left side).

**Don'ts**:

+ Don’t clutter your menu with too many page tabs. Only display pages that are essential to your business. It’s easy to keep adding more pages as you’re passionate about your business. But this may overwhelm your visitors.
Don’t use distracting backgrounds that make menu tabs hard to read. Some people like to add fancy background images / patterns to menu bars. Don’t do that!
Don’t use small font sizes or overly fancy font designs that make it hard for your visitors to read. It can be annoying!

**CHOOSE YOUR MENU BAR POSITION**

Understanding how you want your website visitors to experience your website will guide you to the type of menu bar design you should pick.

1. Fixed Position Menu Bar (menu bar is permanently fixed at the top of the page)

If your website doesn’t have long pages (not content heavy), then having a fixed menu bar at the top of the page becomes less effective (and slightly pointless).  

2. Top Horizontal Menu Bar

80% of websites use this traditional style of menu bar design.

People are conditioned to go to the top of the page when they are looking for the menu bar.

> It’s a very classic menu bar design, and you can’t go wrong with this style most of the time.

3. Side Vertical Menu Bar

Having a menu bar on the side is quite popular with **graphic-intensive** websites (such as a portfolio, restaurant, salon, spa, etc.).

Vertical menu bars are particularly effective if your website has a lot of menu tabs to display, or have menu bar titles that are longer than usual.

Beware that some website templates have “fixed” vertical side menu bar, so there is a limit to how many tabs you can add.  Some design templates have a scrollable vertical menu bar, so the number of tabs you can display is limitless.

4. Bottom Horizontal Menu Bar

This menu bar layout is not too common.  It works exceptionally well for graphic intensive websites where you want your visitors to focus on the immediate content, instead of instinctively start searching for the menu bar.

When the menu bar is placed at the bottom of the page, it eliminates any visual distractions and forces your visitors to focus on the immediate content in front of them. You will see this menu bar design in photography and portfolio websites (interior design, architecture, artists, and etc).

This style of menu bar also works well if you place a lot of links in the content area to guide your visitors around the website.  This way, you are less reliant on the menu bar, as you guide your visitors to different pages with on-page links.

**LOGO POSITIONING**

How your logo is positioned actually says a lot about the goal of your business.

1. Logo placed on the same level / line as your menu bar

This design works best for websites that place more focus on promoting their products or services, and less focused on business branding.  As the logo is on the same level or is contained within the menu bar, the size of the logo is limited.

This is also a design that is mostly used by B2B (business-to-business) types of businesses where branding and marketing are less of a focus than retail businesses.

2. Logo placed in the center with the menu bar (either below or above it)

If you are focused on creating a brand identity, this is the most effective design choice as your logo is more prominently displayed.

This logo layout is quite popular amongst retail businesses as they use various marketing techniques to create a brand identity and to promote brand loyalty.



> Remember: Select a design based on what your website needs, rather than simply what you think looks “pretty”.
