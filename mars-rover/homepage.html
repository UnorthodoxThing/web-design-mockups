      <h2>The Autonomous Exploration Vehicles</h2>

      <p>A Mars rover is a motor vehicle that travels across the surface of the planet Mars upon arrival. Rovers have several advantages over stationary landers: they examine more territory, they can be directed to interesting features, they can
        place themselves in sunny positions to weather winter months, and they can advance the knowledge of how to perform very remote robotic vehicle control.</p>

      <p>There have been four successful robotically operated Mars rovers, all managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory: Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit and Curiosity. On January 24, 2016, NASA reported that current studies on Mars by Curiosity and
        Opportunity (the latter now defunct) would be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine
        environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable.[1][2][3][4] The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on Mars is now a primary NASA objective.[1] In
        June 2018, Opportunity went out of contact after going into hibernation mode in a dust storm.[5] NASA declared the end of the Opportunity mission on February 13, 2019, after numerous failures to wake up the rover.[6]</p>

      <p>Mars 2, Mars 3 were physically tethered probes; Sojourner was dependent on the Mars Pathfinder base station for communication with Earth; MER-A & B and Curiosity were on their own. As of June 2019, Curiosity is still active, while Spirit,
        Opportunity, and Sojourner completed their missions before losing contact.</p>
